        I found the original mod <a href="https://modworkshop.net/mod/28165" title="modworkshop">here</a> and was made by Evaisa. and since it didn't seem to get updated and I had some ideas I have my version here on github with a few things I could think of.
        
        <h3> Installing </h3>
        1. You can download the lates version at the <a href="https://github.com/LFGaming/Discord_rich_presence_noita/releases" title="Releases">Releases</a> tab. Or go to the [Github.io] site where you'll find a dowload button. <br>
        2. Unzip the .zip file in your mods folder. <br>
        3. Start the game and load the mod. <br>
        4. Good luck.
        
        Anything you would like to see added to the mod? Let it know in the <a href="https://github.com/LFGaming/Discord_rich_presence_noita/issues" title="Issues">Issues</a>, make it yourself or contact me on discord at <q>LFGaming#6286</q>.
        
        <h3> TODO:</h3>
        
        - [x] Add death message. <br>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Credits</h3>
        Again, I didn't make the mod it was made by Evaisa and I found it <a href="https://modworkshop.net/mod/28165" title="modworkshop">here</a>. This is just my version where I (overtime) will add some things I can think of.
