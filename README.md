I found the original mod [here] and since it didn't seem to get updated and i had some ideas I have my version here on github.

## installing
1. You can download the lates version at the [Releases] tab. Or go to the [Github.io] site where you'll find a dowload button. <br>
2. Unzip the .zip file in your mods folder. <br>
3. Start the game and load the mod. <br>
4. Good luck.

Anything you would like to see added to the mod? Let it know in the [Issues], make it yourself or contact me on discord at `LFGaming#6286`.

## TODO:

- [x] Add death message.
