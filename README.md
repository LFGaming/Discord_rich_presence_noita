# Discord rich presence for noita

I found the original mod [here] and since it didn't seem to get updated and i had some ideas I have my version here on github.

Have anything you would like to see added to the mod? Make a [Issue], add it yourself or sent me a message on discord `LFGaming#6286`

## TODO: 

- [x] add death message.
