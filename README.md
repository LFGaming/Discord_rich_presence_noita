I found the original mod [here] and since it didn't seem to get updated and i had some ideas I have my version here on github.

Anything you would like to see added to the mod? Let it know in the [Issues], make it yourself or contact me on discord at `LFGaming#6286`.

## TODO:

- [x] Add death message.
